# Advent of Code 2022 from a QA perspective.

Another repository for advent of code by a QA Engineer

I discovered advent of code 2021 on December the 26th... Sadly, I couldn't play last year. 

This year i decided to give it a shot. I'm a QA engineer, not a developer, so I will use my experience in order to give another perspective of this kind of adventure.

Here is some goal i want to achieve : 

* [X] Create user stories for each puzzle. I did it for every story I tried to pass
* [X] Use TDD in order to develop it. That work almost every time.
* [ ] Use continuous integration. Need improvement, for instance we need to resolve #16 before that  
* [ ] Experiment E2E test for more
* [X] Enjoy!

# Advent of Code 2022 from a QA perspective.

Another repository for advent of code by a QA Engineer

I discovered advent of code 2021 on December the 26th... Sadly, I couldn't play last year. 

This year i decided to give it a shot. I'm a QA engineer, not a developer, so I will use my experience in order to give another perspective of this kind of adventure.
